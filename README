FileT - File Transfer with constraints

# Overview
FileT provides centralized secure file exchange between restricted sets of non-technical users. Files are transferred over standard encrypted channels such as HTTPS and SFTP, ensuring that users are not forced to learn or install new tools.

# Deployment
Filet is built for modern Java Application Servers. Just drop the WAR in, and everything should be good to go.

# Future Directions
Interesting features that can be developed after initial release
 - BitTorrent distribution: Use a private tracker to distribute to large groups
 - Amazon S3 datastore: Use Amazon's infrastructure to handle storage, distribution, and authentication
 - OpenID Authentication: External users should be able to authenticate with external means
 - Desktop application: Simple tool for managing new uploads and distribution
